As the AC of Task hadn't exact details and it was not clear on what 
is the base for filtering, i decided to filter data based on 
date and screen type, also i think search on some of fileds could help to finding best results.

i wanted to deploy project on heroku or githab and creat production link but due to task details no need for that.
